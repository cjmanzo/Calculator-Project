## Calculator-Project

## Introduction: 
### This software contains a simple calculator function

## Files:
```sh
Calculator project.py
```
### Contains the first exploration for building a simple calculator. 

## Mechanics
### It grabs 2 digits from the user and executed by only 1 operator, giving a single answer.
```sh
Calculator2 project.py
```
### Contains an update from the first exploration.

## Mechanics
### Grabs multiple digit entry from the user and are executed by multiple operators.

## Future updates: Would be much better if it's put in an infinite loop until user decides to quit the program. Also, a flexible usage will be added where a current answer will be constant unless set back to 0.
